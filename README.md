This game was created to evaluate the knowledge learned in the video game development class. 

# Introduction 

his game is about dodging as many cars as possible so that the car advances faster and makes it more difficult to pass the levels, since every five cars increases the level and the speed.  

# Conclusion

The creation of this video game was made in visual studio code and strengthens the player's dexterity since the faster the level goes, the more concentrated they will have to be to be able to advance as much as possible.

# Entity relationship model

We have the player entity, a player will have a only score that will be updated as it progresses. This, in turn, will have connection with a single vehicle inside. of the game that will be managed by him.

On the other hand, the levels will have many vehicles depending on the level. May it be in its moment.

Finally, we find the shock entity that this would have a relationship with.
with a single vehicle since it only causes one impact.
