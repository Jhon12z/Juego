his game is about dodging as many cars as possible so that the car advances faster and makes it more difficult to pass the levels, since every five cars increases the level and the speed.

The creation of this video game was made in visual studio code and strengthens the player's dexterity since the faster the level goes, the more concentrated they will have to be to be able to advance as much as possible.
